## Bismillah, Hello I'm Azim <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="40px" alt="hi">,

My relationship with programming started at the age of 16 in a vocational high school. I'm obsessed with programming, feel challenged to work on new projects, especially web application development.
